## All Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add some tests' example.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Report issues/bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/adarshaacharya/states-nepal/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/adarshaacharya/states-nepal/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Before filing an issue

- Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.
- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.

## Implement New Feature

If you're planning to implement a new feature I will recommend you to discuss with me before you start coding so you won't end up working on something that I don't want to implement. Create an Issue with proper name and content for discussion.

## Commit and PR Title

It‚Äôs good to have descriptive commit messages so that other folks can make sense of what your commit is doing.
This project uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky/blob/master/README.md) prevent bad `git commit`, `git push` and more üê∂ \_woof!

Read [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/) before making the commit message.

## Requirements

If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
